Got laid off

Got an offer from company A couple of weeks back (Contractors + offer is less)
Company A filed my H1B transfer on Apr 28th (2 days before) and
  got Fedex Tracking No (not Receipt No)
Company A want me to join them on coming Monday with the tracking no; that is April 4th

Got an offer letter from Company B yesterday which is good (Full Time role / not a contract role)
Want to join company B
If I move ahead with Company B and let know the company A I am not joining
on coming Monday...

Will be there be any H1B related issues?...as they company A has already file my H1B

---

Expected joining date for Company B is 23rd Jun

My Grace period starts on May 1st and ends by end of Jun.

If getting the Receipt No is delayed beyond Jun (Say for example I will only
get receipt no in 1st week of july)

what are the options available for me?
  . Do I have to leave by Jul 1st? or
  . Can I apply for Some other visa and wait until I get receipt no on July?

# 5th May is the joining date. H1B is already filed & have
  Fedex tracking no. Can I accept an offer from another company
  before that time...and go ahead with filing H1B with the new Company?

# After 5th May, Once I join, can I accept an offer & join another company
  after couple of weeks or a month?

# Can I stay after 2 months, if I have i140?

# If I go a new company, do I have to immediately file H4 for my dependents?
  My current H1B expires on Feb-15-2022

# 2 months restriction
# If H1B gets reject in this time, where it is not possible to travel..
  What are the options available?
