# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.

# ** Is one of the toughest settings to get it right

# Switch to enable topic deletion or not, default value is false
# Should we allow people to delete topics?
delete.topic.enable=true

############################# Log Basics #############################

# A comma seperated list of directories under which to store log files
# If we have multiple disks, this can be separated with Comma
log.dirs=/data/kafka

# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
# the brokers.
num.partitions=8
# we will have 3 brokers so the default replication factor should be 2 or 3
default.replication.factor=3
# number of ISR to have in order to minimize data loss
# This setting is used when we have acks=all

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age
# this will delete data after a week (168 hours = 7 days)
log.retention.hours=168

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is
# reached a new log segment will be created.
# This default is 1GB
log.segment.bytes=1073741824

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according
# to the retention policies
log.retention.check.interval.ms=300000

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
# ** The /kafka represents the chroot; instead of pull
#   Says connect to the below zookeeper cluster, and the directory
#   I want to be in is /kafka ; so instead of putting all the kafka nodes
#   in root, all the nodes related to kafka will be created inside
#   directory /kafka
#   (If we do not do this, ZK will be come a mess)
zookeeper.connect=zookeeper1:2181,zookeeper2:2181,zookeeper3:2181/kafka

# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=6000
