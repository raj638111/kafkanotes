                                          inactive
                                        Has 2 execution options: --dry-run
                                          (the default) to plan which offsets
                                          to reset, and --execute to update
                                          the offsets. Additionally, the --
                                          export option is used to export the
                                          results to a CSV format.
                                        You must choose one of the following
                                          reset specifications: --to-datetime,
                                          --by-period, --to-earliest, --to-
                                          latest, --shift-by, --from-file, --
                                          to-current.
                                        To define the scope use --all-topics
                                          or --topic. One scope must be
                                          specified unless you use '--from-
                                          file'.
